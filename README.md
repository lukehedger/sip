## Install

```
yarn add sip.css
```

## Sip?

Sip takes micro styles and outputs real CSS:
```
Sip({ m:4 }) // â†£ { margin: 12px }
```

This can be used on components:
```
<Component sip={{ m:4 }} />
```

And processed with any CSS-in-JS implementation or simple inline styles:
```
import Sip from 'sip.css'

const Component = ({ sip }) => <div style={{ ...Sip(sip) }} />
```

## Paradigm

CSS at scale === ðŸ˜«. And scoping your styles to components isn't enough. You still end up with styles tightly coupled to logic. By enforcing an architecture that exposes only a minimal set of presentational components this coupling disappears. These primitive components (Button, Text, View and co) can then be fine-tuned when used by other functional components. `Sip` enables this through the use of atomic-like styles.

## Refreshment

- Framework-agnostic - just outputs CSS objects
- Supports media queries - `sip={{ m:2, m@md: 4 }}`
- Component library and style-guide compatible
- Designed to work with a central set of reusable, presentational components
- Enables any level of application logic refactoring without losing design! And vice-versa.
